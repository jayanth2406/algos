### Major Data Components of Systems Biology

1. **Genomics** $$$$$
   - Study of the entire genetic sequence (genome).
   - Uses DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to understand gene function and interaction.

2. **Transcriptomics** $$$$
   - Analysis of the transcriptome, the collection of all RNA present in a sample.
   - Uses RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to measure gene expression.

3. **Proteomics** $$$$
   - Study of the proteome, the complete set of proteins produced by an organism.
   - Uses mass spectrometry to analyze proteins.

4. **Metabolomics** $$$$
   - Study of metabolites, small molecules involved in metabolism.
   - Identifies biomarkers and helps in understanding metabolic processes.
